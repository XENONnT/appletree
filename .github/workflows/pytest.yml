# Test appletree on each PR.
# We run three types of tests:
#  - Pytest -> these are the "normal" tests and should be run for all
#    python versions
#  - Coveralls -> this is to see if we are covering all our lines of
#    code with our tests. The results get uploaded to
#    coveralls.io/github/XENONnT/appletree
#  - pytest_no_database -> we want to make sure we can run the tests even
#    if we don't have access to our database since this will e.g. happen
#    when someone is pushing a PR from their own fork as we don't
#    propagate our secrets there.
